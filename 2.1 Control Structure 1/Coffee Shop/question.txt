Be aware of those troublesome customersÔºÅ

Some of them would ask for the coffee that is not presented in the menu.


Input
Two integers i, j separated by a space.

Integer i indicates the type of the coffee on the menu (e.g. 1 is AMERICANO, 2 is LATTE, and so on), with range 1-100.

Integer j indicates how many cups of coffee that the client wants, with range 1-20.

Output
If the number of coffee is on the menu, you need to print the total price in the following format: "The total price is <price> dollars!", where <price> is the amount of money that the client should pay.

If not, you need to print "Wait, what?".
