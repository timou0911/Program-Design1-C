European countries use a 12-digit code called European Article Number (EAN) for each product. Each EAN ends with a check digit, which is calculated by the following rules:

Sum up the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, and twelfth digits, and put the result in a.

Sum up the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh digits, and put the result in b.

Multiply a by 3 and add it to b, and put the result in x.

Subtract 1 from x, and put the result in y.

Compute the remainder of y divided by 10, and put the result in z.

Subtract z from 9.

Write a program that reads the first 12 digits of an EAN, and then displays the calculated check digit.

Input
A number with 12 digits.

Output
An 1-digit check digit.
