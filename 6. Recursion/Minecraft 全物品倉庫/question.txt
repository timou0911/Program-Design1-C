As we all know, Minecraft is a game of many ways to play. One day Eric wants to make a full item warehouse in his survival world, but he needs to prepare one of each item before he can make this warehouse, however, each item needs to be prepare once. (The original item means that the item cannot be obtained through craft, but you still need to prepare one)

Since Minecraft items are really too much, the testcase provide a custom craft recipe, and items to a 1 ~ N (1 ≦ N ≦ 20) positive integer representation.

Each of the items 1~N can be crafted by M items.

The test data ensures that there is no need to craft each other, i.e., an item's craft recipe does not appear by itself.

Assuming N = 3, I have the following craft recipe today (see Input Format for more details)

If I want to prepare 1~3 each, I will need to prepare 4 original item.


Input

The first row has a positive integer N (1 ≦ N ≦ 20), representing the current N items, 1~N respectively.

There are N rows, corresponding to the craft recipe of each item from 1 to N. Each item contains the following two rows.

- The first row has a positive integer M (0 ≦ M < N), representing the item needs to be crafted by several items. (M = 0 means that the item is the original item and there is no second row)

- The second row has M positive integers S_1, S_2.... S_M, which means the item should be crafted by those items. (For all 1 ≦ i ≦ M, 1 ≦ S_i ≦ N, and S_i is not duplicated)

Output

The required original items to prepare each one (1~N) items.
