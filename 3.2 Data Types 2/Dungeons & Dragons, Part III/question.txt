In the previous part, we have beat the dragon, and it is time to move on. In this part, we are about to travel through a desert.

In this part, only three dice, with the highest scores of them are 4 (d1), 6 (d2), and 8 (d3), respectively, as well as three magic numbers will be used. The three magic numbers are defined as following:

NUMBER_1 = 0x38E38E38E38E3800LLU
NUMBER_2 = 0x2AAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLU
NUMBER_3 = 0x1C71C71C71C71C71LLU

In your turn, you have to roll three dice and combine the scores of them with three magic numbers:

(d1 * NUMBER_1 + d2 * NUMBER_2 + d3 * NUMBER_3) mod 0x7CE66C50E2840000LLU

Then you will get the steps you should take on your next move (Assume that we have such large map).


Input
Three integers indicates the score of three dice (d1, d2, d3).

Output
Steps the player should take.
