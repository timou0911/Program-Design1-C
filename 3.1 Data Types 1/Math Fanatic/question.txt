Dot is a math fanatic and today he wants to observe the relationship between addition and factorization.

Today there is a sequence S containing N positive integers. If the i-th item of the prefix sum can be divided by Si, then output the i-th item of the prefix sum with Si. If there are more than one set, please output them in the input order. (1<=i<=N)

ex.

S = {1, 3, 7};

Prefix Sum = {1, 4, 11};


It can be observed that there must be a solution because the first term of the prefix sum is the same as the first term of the original sequence, which means it must be divisible.


Input

The first line has a positive integer N (1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5), representing the sequence S with several integers.

The second line has N positive integers S_1, S_2.... S_N, representing the elements of the sequence S. (for all 1 ≦ i ≦ N, 1 ≦ S_i ≦ 10^9)

Output

For the elements that meet the condition, output the prefix and the element separated by a space.

Output each eligible element separated by a new line, if there are multiple groups, please output them in the order of input.
