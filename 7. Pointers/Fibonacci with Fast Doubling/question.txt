We have learned how to calculate the Fibonacci sequence with recursive technique, but there are disadvantages while calculating the sequence with the orginal definition of Fibonacci: fib(k) = fib(k - 1) + fib(k - 2). Firstly, it takes long time to get the result with large k. Secondly, there are lots of numbers being recalculated.

To avoid such disadvantages, a technique called fast doubling was introduced to calculate Fibonacci sequence. As the name of the technique implies, there exists a recursive formula to get fib(2k) and fib(2k + 1) from fib(k) and fib(k + 1), here are the formula:

fib(2k) = fib(k) * [2 * fib(k + 1) - fib(k)]
fib(2k + 1) = fib(k) * fib(k) + fib(k + 1) * fib(k + 1)

where fib(1) = fib(2) = 1
With the formula, the fib(k) could be calculated instantly as well as occupies little amount of memory. with the following loader code, please implement the function fib_fast_doubling().


Input
An integer k with in range 1 ~ 93.

Output
The value of fib(k).
